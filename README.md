## Deep Reinforcement Learning

​		This is a repository tries to reappearance the deep reinforcement learning algorithm proposed in the article **Accuracy-Guaranteed Collaborative DNN Inference in Industrial IoT via Deep Reinforcement Learning**, which was written by **Wen Wu, Member, IEEE, Peng Yang, Member, IEEE, Weiting Zhang, Student Member, IEEE, Conghao Zhou, Student Member, IEEE, and Xuemin (Sherman) Shen, Fellow, IEEE**.

​		

​		There are still bugs need to be fixed in the project, with the realization of the accuracy estimation and plotting in the future
